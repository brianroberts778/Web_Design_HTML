Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard

For this project I've created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past project. Specifically, I've plotted weather data.
In building this dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which one can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Website Details:
The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so one can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.


A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table is a bootstrap table component.

The website, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section.
